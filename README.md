libStromkreis
=============

**libStromkreis**(*German for "Electric Circuit"*) is a *C* based static library that contains a set of programs which solve problems related to *Digital Electronics*  

Presently only the following algorithms are implmented :-  

1. Quineâ€“McCluskey Algorithm  

The following features will be implemented next :-  

*  Espresso Algorithm  
*  A engine which returns cross platform instructions to draw circuit implementations of a given boolean function
